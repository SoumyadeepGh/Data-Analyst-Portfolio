## About

Hi, I'm Soumyadeep Ghosal. With one year of experience at IBM India Pvt. Ltd., I've been working as an Associate System Engineer. 
My role revolves around: 
•	Designed and developed interactive KPI dashboards using Power BI to track organizational performance.
•	Conducted in-depth data analysis using Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) to derive actionable insights.
•	Streamlined data pipelines using ETL processes to ensure clean and consistent data for analysis.
•	Containerized workflows using Docker and Kubernetes, reducing deployment times by 30%.
•	Collaborated with cloud engineering teams to implement scalable data storage solutions on Azure.


During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data Analyst and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Python Projects

#### Insurance Data Analysis

- **Code**: [Insurance Data Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/SoumyadeepGh/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Insurance%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
- **Goal**: To analyze the insurance dataset and create a model to predict the cost of medical insurance based on various input features.
- **Description**: An insurance agency, ABC Insurance, wants to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on their dataset containing information about policyholders and claims to gain insights for better business decisions.
- **Skills**: Data analysis, Exploratory data analysis (EDA), Data visualization, Feature engineering, Machine learning modeling.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- **Results**: Using Python and various data analysis libraries, the project successfully analyzed the insurance dataset. Key findings included the relationship between age, BMI, smoking status, and insurance charges. A machine learning model was built to predict insurance charges based on input features.

### SQL Projects

#### ScienceQtech Employee Performance Mapping

#### Air Cargo Analysis

- **Code**: [Air Cargo Analysis.sql](https://github.com/SoumyadeepGh/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Air_Cargo_Analysis.sql)
- **Goal**: To identify regular customers, analyze busiest routes, and determine ticket sales details to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction at Air Cargo.
- **Description**: This project involved analyzing the dataset of Air Cargo, an aviation company, to identify regular customers for targeted offers, analyze busiest routes for resource allocation, and determine ticket sales details to improve operational efficiency. SQL queries were used to extract relevant information from tables such as Customer, Passengers_on_flights, Ticket_details, and Routes. Tasks included creating an ER diagram, writing queries for data extraction and analysis, implementing constraints, and creating stored procedures and views for efficient data retrieval.
- **Skills**: Data importing, Database management, SQL querying, Data analysis and reporting.
- **Technology**: MySQL Workbench, SQL.
- **Results**: Identified key regular customers who could be targeted with personalized offers, enhancing customer retention. Analyzed the busiest routes, leading to better allocation of aircraft and crew resources. Generated detailed ticket sales reports, providing insights into revenue patterns and helping to optimize pricing strategies.

### Power BI Reports

#### HR Analytics Project

- **Goal**: To analyze HR data for insights on employee demographics, attrition rates, and overall employee wellness.
- **Description**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Removed redundant columns, renamed columns, dropped duplicates, cleaned individual columns, and handled NaN values.
  - **Data Visualization**: Created correlation maps and various charts (bar, donut, and stacked column charts) to analyze relationships between different HR metrics.
  - **Dashboards**:
    - Overview: Summary of all dashboards.
    - Demographic Insights: Key demographic data.
    - Turnover Analysis 1: Attrition by education field, marital status, and job role.
    - Turnover Analysis 2: Attrition by business travel, department, and years in current role.
    - Employee Wellness: Environmental satisfaction, job involvement, relationship satisfaction

, performance rating, and work-life balance.
  - **Conclusion**: The project provided actionable insights into factors influencing employee attrition and overall wellness, aiding in strategic HR decision-making.

#### Zomato Project

- **Goal**: To analyze the Zomato dataset to understand the distribution of restaurants, analyze ratings, and identify trends in customer reviews.
- **Description**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Processed the dataset to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize data formats.
  - **Data Visualization**: Created various charts (bar, line, and pie charts) to visualize restaurant distribution by location, cuisine, and rating distribution.
  - **Analysis**: Analyzed factors influencing restaurant ratings and customer reviews, identified popular cuisines and high-demand areas.
- **Skills**: Data cleaning, Data visualization, Exploratory data analysis (EDA), Trend analysis.
- **Technology**: Power BI.
- **Result**: The Zomato project provided insights into restaurant trends, popular cuisines, and factors affecting ratings. This analysis helps in understanding market dynamics and can guide business decisions for restaurant management and marketing strategies.
